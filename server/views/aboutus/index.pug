    h4 1. Introduction
    p
    |    This User Agreement, all policies and additional terms posted on and in our sites, applications, tools and services (collectively "Services") set out the terms on which AllYouNeed offers you access to and use of our Services. All policies and additional terms posted on and in our sites, applications, tools, and services are incorporated into this User Agreement. You agree to comply with all terms of this User Agreement when accessing or using our Services.
    |    The entity you are contracting with is: AllYouNeed Inc., 2025 Hamilton Ave., San Jose, CA 95125, if you reside in the United States; AllYouNeed (UK) Limited, 1 More London Place, London, SE1 2AF, United Kingdom, if you reside in the United Kingdom; AllYouNeed GmbH, Albert-Einstein-Ring 2-6, 14532 Kleinmachnow, Germany, if you reside outside the United Kingdom but within the European Union; AllYouNeed Canada Limited, 500 King Street West, Suite 200, Toronto, ON M5V 1L9, Canada, if you reside in Canada; if you reside in India, AllYouNeed Singapore Services Pte Ltd., 10 Collyer Quay, #10-01 Ocean Financial Centre, Singapore 049315; and AllYouNeed Marketplaces GmbH, Helvetiastrasse 15/17, 3005, Bern, Switzerland, if you reside in any other country.

    |    Please be advised that this User Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you and we have against each other are resolved (see "Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability" and "Legal Disputes" provisions below). It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us or our agents to binding and final arbitration, unless you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.

    h4 2. About AllYouNeed
    p    AllYouNeed is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about anything in a variety of pricing formats and locations. The actual contract for sale is directly between the seller and buyer. AllYouNeed is not a traditional auctioneer.
    |    Any guidance we provide as part of our Services, such as pricing, shipping, listing, and sourcing is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, AllYouNeed has no control over and does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.
    h4 3. Using AllYouNeed
    p   In connection with using or accessing the Services you will not:
        ul
            li post, list or upload content or items in inappropriate categories or areas on our sites;

            li fail to pay for items purchased by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an AllYouNeed policy, for example, the seller has materially changed the item's description after you bid, a clear typographical error is made, or you cannot contact the seller
            li fail to deliver items sold by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an AllYouNeed policy, for example, the buyer fails to comply with the posted terms in your listing or you cannot contact the buyer;

            li post false, inaccurate, misleading, deceptive, defamatory, or libelous content;

            li interfere with the working of our Services, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
            li export or re-export any AllYouNeed application or tool, except in compliance with the export control laws of any relevant jurisdictions and in accordance with posted rules and restrictions;
            li infringe the copyright, trademark, patent, publicity, moral, database, and/or other intellectual property rights (collectively, "Intellectual Property Rights") that belong to or are licensed to AllYouNeed. Some, but not all, actions that may constitute infringement are reproducing, performing, displaying, distributing, copying, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or preparing derivative works from content that belongs to AllYouNeed or someone else;
            li infringe any Intellectual Property Rights that belong to third parties affected by your use of the Services or post content that does not belong to you;
            li commercialize any AllYouNeed application or any information or software associated with such application, except with the prior express permission of AllYouNeed;
            li harvest or otherwise collect information about users without their consent; or
            li circumvent any technical measures used to provide the Services.
    |Sellers must meet AllYouNeed's minimum performance standards. Failure to meet these standards may result in AllYouNeed charging you additional fees, and/or limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading your seller account.
    |If we believe you are abusing AllYouNeed and/or our Services in any way, we may, in our sole discretion and without limiting other remedies, limit, suspend, or terminate your user account(s) and access to our Services, delay or remove hosted content, remove any special status associated with your account(s), remove, not display, and/or demote listings, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent you from using our Services.
    |If we believe you are violating the policy on Offers to buy or sell outside of AllYouNeed, you may be subject to a range of actions, including limits on your buying and selling privileges, restrictions on listings and account features, suspension of your account, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement. If you are a seller and you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of AllYouNeed, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if the item does not sell.
    |We may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone for any reason at our discretion.
    h4  4. Policy Enforcement
    p When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user's performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers.
    h4  5. Fees and Taxes
    p The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our Standard selling fees page. We may change our seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the AllYouNeed site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.
    |If you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all sales made using some or all AllYouNeed Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made outside of AllYouNeed. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of AllYouNeed, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if the item doesn't sell, given your usage of AllYouNeed Services for the introduction to a buyer.
    |You must have a payment method on file when selling through AllYouNeed Services and pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect amounts owed by charging other payment methods on file with us, retain collection agencies and legal counsel, and, for accounts over 60 days past due, request that PayPal deduct the amount owed from your PayPal account balance. In addition, you will be subject to late fees. AllYouNeed, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information AllYouNeed reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at AllYouNeed Inc., C/O Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your AllYouNeed account, you must contact the collection agency directly.
    |In any jurisdiction where AllYouNeed has an obligation to collect sales taxes on sales you make using AllYouNeed Services, we may collect such sales taxes from you via the payment method on file under the terms of the Billing Agreement or via any other means available to us.
    |Seller fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on AllYouNeed, whether on a web page, mobile app, or otherwise. We may display third-party advertisements (including links and references thereto) or other content in any part of our Services, in our sole discretion and without consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or other credit to, sellers.
    h4 6. Listing Conditions
    p When listing an item for sale on AllYouNeed Services, you agree to comply with AllYouNeed's Listing policies and Selling practices policy and that:
        ul
            li You are responsible for the accuracy and content of the listing and item offered,
            li Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances). AllYouNeed can't guarantee exact listing durations,
            li Your fixed-price listings currently renew automatically every 30 days, based on the listing terms at that time, until the quantities sell out or until you cancel the listing. Effective July 1, 2019, your fixed-price listings may renew automatically every calendar month, based on the listing terms at the time, until all quantities sell or the listing is ended by you or AllYouNeed, in its sole discretion,
            li Content that violates any of AllYouNeed's policies may be modified, obfuscated or deleted at AllYouNeed's discretion,
            li We may revise product data associated with listings to supplement, remove, or correct information,
            li We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for. Therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
                ul                            
                    li buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history;
                    li item's location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query;
                    li seller's history, including listing practices, Detailed Seller Ratings, AllYouNeed policy compliance, Feedback, and defect rate; and
                    li number of listings matching the buyer's query,
            li To drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer,
            li Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on certain Services,
            li AllYouNeed's Duplicate listings Policy may also affect whether your listing appears in search results
            li Metatags and URL links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered so as to not affect third-party search engine results,
            li We may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating your listings. Such recommendations may be based on the aggregated sales and performance history of similar sold and current listings; results will vary for individual listings. To drive the recommendations experience, you agree that we may display the sales and performance history of your individual listings to those of other sellers.
    h4 7. Purchase Conditions
    p When buying an item on AllYouNeed Services, you agree to the Rules and policies for buyers and that:
        ul
            li You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or commitment to buy,
            li You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item, your offer for an item is accepted, or if you have the winning bid (or your bid is otherwise accepted),
            li For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller,
            li We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer,
            li Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise.
    h4 8. International Buying and Selling; Translation
    p Many of our Services are accessible to international sellers and buyers. We may offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items. If you purchase an item on an AllYouNeed site other than allyouneed.com, you are subject to the User Agreement of that other AllYouNeed site with respect to that particular purchase.
    |You may list your items directly on one or more of AllYouNeed's international sites. Additionally, you may direct us to display your listing on AllYouNeed sites other than the original AllYouNeed listing site, including where you choose to list an item with an international shipping option (such as worldwide shipping or the Global Shipping Program); the appearance of your listings on these sites is not guaranteed. When you sell your items internationally, you agree to be subject to that other site's User Agreement, policies, and our AllYouNeed Money Back Guarantee. You may adjust your account settings within My AllYouNeed to indicate your preferences on international shipping by excluding international shipping and applying an exclusion list to the applicable countries.
    |You authorize us to use automated tools to translate your AllYouNeed content and member-to-member communications, in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are available. We may provide you with tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed.
